# MPS Message Tab Util

This tiny plugin simplifies the usage of the message tab of the MPS messages view, which can be handy for, e.g., debugging purposes.

The plugin contains the following actions:
- `Clear MPS Default Message Tab`: Clears the message tab. Assign a shortcut to the action if you like to use it frequently. This action avoids using the mouse as you can not assign an shortcut to the original action.
- `Set MPS Default Message Tab Active/Inactive`: If active, the message tab is moved to the front whenever a new message is added. This avoids switching from e.g. Make-Tab to the Messages-Tab in some cases.

The plugin also has an project plugin that sets the message tab to active on MPS start.

Developed with MPS 2023.2, no dependencies.
